## Chronic Kidney Disease Rate (Adult Population) 
Chronic Kidney Disease Rate (Adult Population) 

### Why is this important?
Roughly [30 million](https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/basics.html) American adults have chronic kidney disease, or CKD. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 48% of people not already treating their advanced chronic kidney disease don't even know they have it. 

In 2017, 3.37% of Durham County's adult male patients had chronic kidney disease at Stage 3 or higher (with 60% or less of kidney function). It is not until stage 4, the last stage before kidney failure, that severe outward symptoms present themselves. People with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or obesity are at greater risk of developing CKD.

### About the Data
This information is from Duke Health and Lincoln Community Health Center, provided by Duke's [Center for Community and Population Health Improvement](http://www.dukehealthimprovement.org/). These chronic kidney disease rates are based on health care visits documented in this combined dataset, including a total of 169,115 adults of a countywide total of 245,572 (2017). Rates selected for inclusion in this site are those matching Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines as reported by Duke Health.

When a patient has an interaction with a healthcare provider, this is called an encounter. An encounter can be a single, brief event (such as a regular primary care appointment) or it can be across multiple days (such as a hospital stay). To determine metrics for a particular year, Duke Health Technology only includes adult patients who had an encounter in that same calendar year. If a patient had a hospitalization that lasted multiple days across two calendar years (e.g. 12/15/15 – 1/15/16), DHT used the discharge date to determine their inclusion.
