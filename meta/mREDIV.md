## Racial & Ethnic Diversity
Racial & Ethnic Diversity

### Why is this important?
Diversity is a deeply valued component of our community, reflecting our mutual human rights and values, and equal access to opportunity for people of all races and ethnicities. Research on racial and ethnic diversity has shown that it influences social solidarity, trust, and tolerance. Studies have illustrated that neighborhood racial and ethnic diversity is positively correlated with increased physical exercise, feelings of greater community belonging, and greater social mobility (see Promoting Neighborhood Diversity below). 

### About the Data
The calculation of this measurement uses the Simpson Index of Diversity, which measures the variety and evenness of different groups. The component numbers for this measure are blockgroup counts of White (not Hispanic), Black or African American (not Hispanic), Asian (not Hispanic), Hispanic or Latino/a, Two or More Races (not Hispanic), and Other (not Hispanic). A higher number in this measure reflects both a higher number of race/ethnicity categories present and more people of each identity present. A diversity measurement of 1 would mean all race and ethnicity identities are present and equally represented, while a measure of 0 would indicate only one race or ethnicity is present.
