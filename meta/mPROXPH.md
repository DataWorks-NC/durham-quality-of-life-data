## Households Within Walking Distance to Pharmacies
Households Within Walking Distance to Pharmacies

### Why is this important?
Pharmacies are among the core services a community needs. They allow access to prescriptions and basic household pharmaceuticals, medical devices and preventative care products. In addition, many pharmacies offer 'minute-clinics' for basic primary care services.

### About the Data
Pharmacies include traditional storefront locations of independent and chain drug stores, as well as big-box retail locations. These are identified primarily by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 44611 and then conducting a qualitative scan of additional community businesses. Households are identified in this case as parcels with dwelling units and the 1/4 mile distance is Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units within a 1/4 mile of pharmacies by the total number of dwelling units in the blockgroup. Which blockgroup a parcel belongs to is determined by where its centroid is placed.
