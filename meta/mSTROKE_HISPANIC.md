## Stroke Rate (Latino/a or Hispanic Population)
Stroke Rate (Latino/a or Hispanic Population) 

### Why is this important?
As the [CDC points out](https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/index.htm) more than three quarters of a million people suffer from stroke in the United States each year - the equivalent of one happening every 40 seconds. And while many of these are preventable, stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability. 

In 2017, 0.65% of Durham County's adult Latino/a or Hispanic patients (97 people) had a stroke. Stroke is a condition in which blood flow to the brain is blocked or a blood vessel actually bursts and bleeds into the brain. This causes brain cells to die leading to confusion, numbness in the body, and vision, speech or mobility impairments. People can be more at risk for reasons they can control (smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol) or for reasons they can't control (like racism, sex, environmental influences, or age). But stroke can be treated through a variety of prevention, therapy, and rehab.

This leads to confusion, numbness in the body, and vision, speech or mobility impairments. People can be more at risk for reasons they have more control over (stress, smoking, alcohol consumption, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol) or for reasons they can't control (like racism, sex, environmental influences, stress or age). Preventive steps include:  increasing physical activity, eating a healthy diet, managing stress, managing diabetes, decreasing cholesterol, and decreasing hypertension. Rehabilitation can help a person to regain some function after a stroke occurs.

### About the Data
This information is from Duke Health and Lincoln Community Health Center, provided by Duke's [Center for Community and Population Health Improvement](http://www.dukehealthimprovement.org/). These stroke rates are based on health care visits documented in this combined dataset, including a total of 169,115 adults of a countywide total of 245,572 (2017).

When a patient has an interaction with a healthcare provider, this is called an encounter. An encounter can be a single, brief event (such as a regular primary care appointment) or it can be across multiple days (such as a hospital stay). To determine metrics for a particular year, Duke Health Technology only includes adult patients who had an encounter in that same calendar year. If a patient had a hospitalization that lasted multiple days across two calendar years (e.g. 12/15/15 â€“ 1/15/16), DHT used the discharge date to determine their inclusion.
