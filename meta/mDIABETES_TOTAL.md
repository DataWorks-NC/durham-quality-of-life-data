### Why is this important?
Health, as defined in the 2018 book [Healing Our Divided Society](http://www.eisenhowerfoundation.org/link1a), is "the state of physical, mental, spiritual and socio-economic well-being of the individual and thus their community, not simply the absence of disease or infirmity". And the [Constitution of the World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/about/mission/en/) states that "the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition."

Diabetes is a condition in which we can't process sugars, burdening our kidneys and causing damage across the systems of our bodies. People managing the conditions of diabetes experience symptoms like 1, 2, 3. This can lead to difficult outcomes like loss of vision, limited mobility, kidney conditions or worse. But it can be managed and overcome when people can control their ability to exercise and change their diet. What are key ways people access these needs?
