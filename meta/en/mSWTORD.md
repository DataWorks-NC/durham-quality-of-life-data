## Sidewalk Coverage
Sidewalk Coverage

### Why is this important?
Sidewalk coverage measurements show how well-served an area is by having walkable spaces. Investment in improving pedestrian infrastructure, which includes sidewalk installation, creates safer neighborhoods by reducing pedestrian fatalities, and providing a safer route for students who walk to nearby schools.

### About the Data
This measurement indicates how much length of sidewalk exists along roadways in a given neighborhood. Pedestrian or bike paths not adjacent to roadways are not among the sidewalks counted here. Areas reporting no data are outside City limits and do not contain annexed communities. Neither the City nor County maintain or build sidewalks in those areas.
