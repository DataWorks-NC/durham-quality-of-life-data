## Drug Crimes per Square Mile
Drug Crimes per Square Mile

### Why is this important?
These data show the number of drug-related incidents reported by the police department, and so, it directly reflects where policing of drug-related incidents occurs. Unreported drug-related incidents are not counted in this data (e.g., drug-related activities that are not surveilled by the police).

This metric is useful to track because drug crimes impact individuals, households, neighborhoods and the community as a whole. Drug crimes are often linked with other violent and property crimes, as well as with physical and mental health issues. Historic data show that neighborhoods with more residents of color and those with lower income experience more frequent policing, which itself can compromise residents’ safety as well. It’s also useful for communities to be able to track where policing of drug crimes is occurring.
