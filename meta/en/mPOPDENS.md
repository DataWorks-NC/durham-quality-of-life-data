## Population
Population

### Why is this important?
Total population indicates the number of people living in a selected area. Trends of population increase or decrease can help the City, County and other service providers know where infrastructure and other services may be needed. 

On the Neighborhood Compass map, you'll see population density rather than total population to allow easier visual comparisons between different areas of the County. But if you select an area on the map, the legend will show the total population. Population density indicates the number of people living in a selected boundary divided by the area (in square miles) of the boundary. Density of population helps the City, County and other service providers know where infrastructure and other services are used most. Businesses might use population density to understand where markets exist for goods and services.

### About the Data
For 2010, this data is from the 2010 Decennial Census 100% population counts. For 2015 and later years, this data comes from the American Community Survey, a sample-based survey largely conducted by telephone.
