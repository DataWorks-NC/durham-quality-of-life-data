## Households Within Walking Distance to Bus Stops
Households Within Walking Distance to Bus Stops

### Why is this important?
Household proximity to public transit indicates transportation options for those with cars and indicates access to regional transportation for those without cars. This measurement is one of three included in the Compass that gauge the effectiveness of public transit service to neighborhoods (daily and nightly bus arrivals are the other two).

### About the Data
Households include all residential units, not just residential parcels. Bus stop locations used in this calculation are those active during the spring of each calendar year. Households are identified in this case as parcels with dwelling units and the 1/4 mile distance is Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units within a 1/4 mile of bus stops by the total number of dwelling units in the blockgroup. Which blockgroup a parcel belongs to is determined by where its centroid is placed.
