## Median Homebuyer Income
Median Homebuyer Income

### Why is this important?
The relative wealth of homebuyers in neighborhoods can help express neighborhood changes over time, answering questions about gentrification and who real estate development serves. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data is one of the only reliable sources of lending patterns at the neighborhood level. Along with understanding the socioeconomic character of borrowers (seen here), it reports whether a mortgage is originated, its value, and whether it is for investment or owner-occupancy. 

### About the Data
NOTE: Median homebuyer income is  no longer reported here in  inflation-adjusted values. These are annual nominal dollar values and are therefore comparable to the dollar values reported in median household income and median home price. Records included in this analysis are for originated, owner-occupant mortgages only.
