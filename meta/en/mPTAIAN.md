### Why is this important?
The top four tribal affiliations reported by Durham County residents in 2019 were Cherokee, Chippewa, Navajo and Sioux in 2019. Durham County sits on land that historically belonged to the Eno, Tuscarora and Occcaneechi peoples, among others. Today, the Occaneechi band of the Saponi nation is active and [working to buy back parts of their ancestral lands in Alamance County](https://obsn.org/homeland-preservation-project/).

While Durham as a city was founded long after the waves of forced displacement that tore native people across NC from their land, the entire system of land ownership in the city and county [still rests on that foundation of violence and theft](https://www.bullcity150.org/uneven_ground/violence_theft/).

### About the Data
These data come from the U.S. Decennial Census and the American Community Survey. The Census Bureau categorizes respondents' race into one of 6 racial categories, one of which is "American Indian and Alaska Native," or AIAN. The census labels people's race as AIAN when they meet the definition of "a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment." 

In the Compass, we display the "AIAN alone or in combination with one or more other races" census count, which includes a significant number of people who reported their race as white and AIAN (1,376 in 2019) and Black and AIAN (829 in 2019), alongside folks who were identified only as AIAN (375 in 2019).
