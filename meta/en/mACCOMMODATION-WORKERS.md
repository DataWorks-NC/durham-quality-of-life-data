Percent of workers in the arts, entertainment, recreation, and accommodation & food services

### Why is this important?
Across the United States, workers are facing mass layoffs and closures due to COVID-19. Many of these workers are in the types of jobs that have grown greatly in number as our economy has changed over the last 20 years. But their wages have not seen the same growth. In Durham, for example, accommodation and food service jobs grew in number by 69% from 2000 to 2018. These workers made $390/week in the year 2000 and $381/week in 2018 (inflation adjusted amounts from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages).

### About the Data
These estimates refer to the civilian employed population 16 years and over who are working in these sectors: arts, entertainment, and recreation, and accommodation and food services.
