## White Population
White Population

### Why is this important?
Information on race is required for many Federal programs and is critical in making policy decisions, particularly for civil rights. States use these data to meet legislative redistricting principles. Race data also are used to promote equal employment opportunities and to assess racial disparities in health and environmental risks.

### About the Data
The percent of the total population reporting their race to be White and ethnicity as not Latino or Hispanic. Ethnicity is a separate characteristic from race and individuals reporting their ethnicity to be Latino or Hispanic may also report a race description such as White or African American.

_Census boundaries changed in 2020. Data from 2020 are weighted to maintain the boundaries from 2010 using [methodology and crosswalks from IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/geographic-crosswalks)._
