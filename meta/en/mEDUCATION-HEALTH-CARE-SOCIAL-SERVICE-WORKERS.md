Percent of workers in educational, health care and social assistance services

### Why is this important?
In Durham County more people work in education, health care and social assistance (“eds and meds”) than any other sector - 53,269, or 33.6% of all workers (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, 2018). These workers are deemed essential for the function of our society and the safety of our community - and this is especially so in times of pandemic as we now face with COVID-19. Currently, teachers are rapidly transitioning curricula to virtual formats (when possible), and health care workers are on the job without adequate protective equipment.[1](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21194402/coronavirus-masks-n95-respirators-personal-protective-equipment-ppe),[2](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/16/814929294/covid-19-has-caused-a-shortage-of-face-masks-but-theyre-surprisingly-hard-to-mak)

But within these job sectors there are also long-standing inequities. For example in health care, while some essential workers (certified nurse assistants) make a fraction of others (specialist doctors), their wages have also further diverged since 2000 - [low wages stagnating and high salaries growing steadily](https://dataworks-nc.org/wp-content/uploads/health_wages_durham_rents_2-01-scaled.jpg).
