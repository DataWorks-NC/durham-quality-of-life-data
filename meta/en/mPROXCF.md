## HHouseholds Within Walking Distance to Fast Food and Convenience Stores
Households Within Walking Distance to Fast Food and Convenience Stores

### Why is this important?
Everyone needs healthy food options. This includes not only being able to purchase or receive foods but also getting to food outlets safely, whether on foot, bike, by transit or car. People without access to cars - between 10,000 and 11,000 households in Durham County (American Community Survey, 2016) - are especially likely to rely on fast food and convenience food locations when full service grocers and farmers markets are not nearby. 

### About the Data
Fast food and convenience store locations include fast food chains, gas station/convenience stores, dollar stores and pizza places. These are identified first by using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for convenience stores and fast food in the InfoUSA data set and then conducting a qualitative scan of additional community businesses. Households are identified in this case as parcels with dwelling units and the 1/4 mile distance is Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units within a 1/4 mile of these food retailers by the total number of dwelling units in the blockgroup. Which blockgroup a parcel belongs to is determined by where its centroid is placed.
