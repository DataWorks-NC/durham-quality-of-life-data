## Violent Crimes per Square Mile
Violent Crimes per Square Mile

### Why is this important?
These data show the number of violent incidents reported by the police department, and so, it directly reflects where policing of violent incidents occurs. Unreported violent incidents are not counted in this data (e.g. violent activities that are not surveilled by the police).

It is useful to track violent crimes because residents, organizations, and government alike can use this information to address high rates of violent crime.Since historic data show that neighborhoods with more residents of color and those with lower income experience more frequent policing, which itself can compromise residents’ safety as well, it’s also useful for communities to be able to track where policing of violent crimes is occurring.

### About the Data
The violent crimes per square mile metric shows the average number of arrests per square mile for violent crimes by the City of Durham Police. Reported violent crimes include simple assaults, certain sex offenses, child abuse and kidnapping. The number of property crimes occurring in each boundary is divided by the area (in square miles) of the boundary, rather than the population. This is intended to control for how crime often happens in areas that are less populated. For more detailed Durham crime reporting visit [RAIDS Online](https://communitycrimemap.com/).
