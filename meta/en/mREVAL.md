## Percent Change in Residential Property Values
Percent Change in Residential Property Values 

### Why is this important?
Every few years, the County reappraises property values to adjust how much residents pay in property taxes. In North Carolina that process has to happen at least every 8 years and recently Durham started these revaluations on a 4-year cycle. The first cycle was 3 years (2016 - 2019).

Increases in residential property value can make a major impact on low-income or fixed-income households. For every 100 dollars of assessed property value, in 2025 a resident of the City would pay $0.9913 in combined City and County taxes. If you own a home valued at $200,000 and it is revalued at $300,000 your annual tax payment will increase from $1,982 to $2,973. In 2019, more than 27,000 residential properties increased in tax value by 100% or more.

How have values changed in your neighborhood? Are your neighbors having difficulty keeping up with costs?
