## Percent Change in Residential Property Values
Percent Change in Residential Property Values 

### Why is this important?
The increase in residential property values across neighborhoods can make a major impact on low-income or fixed-income households. For every 100 dollars of assessed property value, a resident of the City will pay $1.2439 in combined City and County taxes. If you own a home valued at $100,000 and it is revalued at $150,000 your annual tax payment will increase from $1,244 to $1,865. In 2019, more than 3,900 properties increased in tax value by 100% or more.

### About the Data
This rate of change is derived from parcel point data from 2017 (previous to the most recent property tax revaluation) and 2019. For the year 2016 reported here, records were used from 2014 and 2016 to compare. 

The number reported here is a median rate of change for every property in a blockgroup. Properties with zero value in 2017 or zero values in both years were excluded from this calculation to prevent skewing by outliers.
