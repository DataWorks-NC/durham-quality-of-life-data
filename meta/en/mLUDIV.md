## Racial & Ethnic Diversity
Land Use Diversity

### Why is this important?
The diversity of land uses can reflect the richness of social and economic life in a community. Just as mixed uses in a single property are desirable for bringing people and their service or amenity needs closer to one another, the same is true within neighborhoods. Increased land use diversity can have transportation, health and environmental implications as well as create greater collocation of jobs and housing. But it is not a guaranteed positive, as fewer types of land use may entail concentrations of residential property near a selection of core community commercial services (being only two types of land use in unequal numbers).

### About the Data
The calculation of this measurement uses the Simpson Index of Diversity, which measures the variety and evenness of different groups. A higher number in this measure reflects both a higher number of land use types in each area and a more balanced number of properties among them. Parcels are categorized as: agricultural, residential, commercial, recreation, industrial, community services, public services (utilities), wild and forested lands. A measure of 1 would mean each of the possible types of land use is present and that there is an equal number of each. A measure of 0 would mean only one type is present.
