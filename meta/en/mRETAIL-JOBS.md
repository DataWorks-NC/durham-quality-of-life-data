Percent of workers in the retail trade industry

### Why is this important?
Among employment sectors hit the hardest during the COVID-19 pandemic, retail trade jobs employed nearly 13,000 Durham County workers in 2018 (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages). Even before this pandemic prompted ongoing layoffs and closures that are leaving retail employees out of work, the combination of [stagnant wages and rapidly increasing rents](https://dataworks-nc.org/wp-content/uploads/retail_food_wages_durham_2-scaled.jpg) was becoming untenable in Durham. For retail workers in Durham county, average weekly wages were $566 in the year 2000 and $573 in 2018 (in 2018 dollars).
