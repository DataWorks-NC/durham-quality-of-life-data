## Heart Attack (Black or African American Population) 
Heart Attack Rate (Black or African American Population) 

### Why is this important?
Heart attacks (also called myocardial infarction) occur when a coronary artery is fully or partially blocked, stopping blood flow to the heart. Most of these incidents happen because of a buildup of substances like cholesterol in the artery, but spasms induced by drug use can also cause an attack.  

In 2017 1,363 Black or African American adults in Durham County were diagnosed with heart attacks, 2.16% of the 63,142 Black or African American adult patients treated at Duke and Lincoln Community Health.

Stress in your life - especially chronic or recurring stress - can be a major factor leading to heart disease and heart attack. Racism, financial pressure, housing instability, and rapid community change all cause stress in our lives. Another major influence on heart disease and heart attack is exposure to air pollution - which is itself a chronic physical stress for our bodies.    

To reduce one’s risk of heart attacks, there are seven factors to keep in mind. These include an individual’s:  smoking status, diet, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose (Life’s Simple 7, The American Heart Association).  Research shows that people who maintain optimal levels for just three to four of these measures cut their risk of heart-related death by more than half.  

### About the Data
This information is from Duke Health and Lincoln Community Health Center, provided by Duke's [Center for Community and Population Health Improvement](http://www.dukehealthimprovement.org/). Heart attack or MI diagnoses are based on health care visits documented in this combined dataset, including a total of 169,115 adults of a countywide total of 245,572 (2017). Heart attack or MI incidents are those coded as ICD 410.01, 410.11, 410.21, 410.31, 410.41, 410.51, 410.61, 410.71, 410.81, 410.91, I21, I22 and I25.2.

When a patient has an interaction with a healthcare provider, this is called an encounter. An encounter can be a single, brief event (such as a regular primary care appointment) or it can be across multiple days (such as a hospital stay). To determine metrics for a particular year, Duke Health Technology only includes adult patients who had an encounter in that same calendar year. If a patient had a hospitalization that lasted multiple days across two calendar years (e.g. 12/15/15 – 1/15/16), DHT used the discharge date to determine their inclusion.
