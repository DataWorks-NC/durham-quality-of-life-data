### Why is this important?

### About the Data
We calculate median home price as the median sale price for single-family residential properties over a three year period, centered on the metric year, for time periods with more than five sales total. So, for example, for the year 2019, the metric value will be the median sale price for any residential sales which occured between Jan 1, 2018 and Dec 31, 2020. If there were five or fewer sales during that time period within the selected census area, the metric value will show no data.

We count as a sale any qualified real estate transaction with a non-zero sale price. This metric excludes, for example, foreclosure sales, sales between related parties, and multiparcel sales. It only includes single-family residential properties. Sales prices are *not* adjusted for inflation.
